# Hybrid Network Topology using Scilab

This repository contains the implementation of a Hybrid Network Topology
using Scilab and the NARVAL toolbox as part of the Computer Networks Lab.

The hybrid topology is created by combining Bus, Ring, and Star topologies.
The repository includes the Scilab source code and screenshots of the
generated outputs.

## Tools Used
- Scilab 6.1.1
- NARVAL Toolbox
- macOS (Intel)

## Contents
- hybrid.sce : Scilab code for hybrid topology creation and analysis
- screenshots/ : Output graphs and console results

## Features
- Hybrid topology creation (Bus + Ring + Star)
- Visualization of nodes and edges
- Node and edge numbering
- Colouring of nodes and edges
- Edge count for each node
- Identification of node with maximum edges
